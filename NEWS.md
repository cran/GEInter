# GEInter 0.3.1

* Fix the warning of "data length is different from matrix size". 


# GEInter 0.3.0

* A new data set `HNSCC` has been added as an example of practical data analysis.

# GEInter 0.2.0

* Function `Augmentated.data` is replaced by `Augmented.data`.
* In `plot.bic.BLMCP`,  `plot.bic.PTReg`, `plot.BLMCP`, `plot.Miss.boosting`, `plot.PTReg`, and `plot.RobSBoosting`, 
  genetic and environmental variables in the heat maps of are allowed to have the provided names (corresponding 
  to the column names of the input variables of the corresponding S3 object).
* Added `E_type` option for `Augmentated.data`, `Miss.boosting` and `RobSBoosting` to better accommodate practical data 
  instead of identifying the type of environmental variables automatically.

# GEInter 0.1.0 

* Note that this starts from version `GEInter_0.1.0`.
